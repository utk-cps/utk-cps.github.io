            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Disease Impact on Economics:</strong> The US dairy producers are estimated to lose over $2 billion annually. Prevalent diseases such as mastitis, lameness, and metabolic alterations significantly affect the health of dairy herds, impacting milk production and quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Difficulty in Early Detection:</strong> Effective control of these diseases is difficult by challenges in early detection and diagnosis, particularly in identifying subclinical forms, which are more common and easily transmitted among the herd before they can be identified.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost-Effective Solutions:</strong> Implementing practical solutions for disease control and monitoring in dairy farms is constrained by the need for cost-effective solutions that can be easily deployed, as expensive solutions are less likely to be adopted in the field.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Solutions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Integrated Sensing and AI Analytics Framework:</strong> Development of a comprehensive framework that combines advanced sensing technologies and AI-driven data analytics for real-time detection and control of multiple diseases in dairy herds.</li>
                <li><strong>Farm-wide Disease Control Strategy:</strong> Implementation of a farm-wide control strategy using data-driven decision-making assistance and digital twin simulations to analyze and manage disease spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost-effective Disease Monitoring:</strong> Establishment of a sustainable and cost-effective approach for continuous monitoring of health indicators such as somatic cell count (SCC) and pathogens, leveraging novel sensing methods, machine learning, and sensor-based networks.</li>
            </ul>
